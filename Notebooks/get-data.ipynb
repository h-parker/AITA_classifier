       "  \"META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world\",\n",
       "  \"I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\\n\\nGiven that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\\n\\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\\n\\nThey’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\\n\\nThe internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\\n\\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.\\n\\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.\\n\\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\\n\\nEdit 2: Wow, this got very big. It’s gonna take me a minute to read all this. \\n\\nAnd alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. Academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody’s business, so I might have a warped view on this one. \\n\\nEdit 3: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”\",\n",

       "  'I\\'m back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here\\'s my update.\\n\\nWell, since that day I made the post i\\'ve been staying with my grandfather. The week\\'s been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i\\'ll try to run it down.\\n\\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don\\'t feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn\\'t end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i\\'ve felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i\\'ve lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\\n\\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won\\'t lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\\n\\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I\\'m not going back. Later today i\\'m going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i\\'m planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\\n\\nI won\\'t be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i\\'ve learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don\\'t hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\\n\\nSo, there\\'s my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I\\'ll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it\\'s kinda cliche and i\\'ve said it a thousand times but thank you all. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it\\'s at my grandpa\\'s house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all for the advice and love. It\\'s been amazing and i\\'m glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don\\'t know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i\\'ll maybe come around again. But for now I\\'m going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy\\'s :)',\n",

Everyone’s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. \\n\\nSince I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I’m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. \\n\\nThe funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \\n\\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \\n\\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \\n\\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \\n\\nI’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \\n\\nI haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to.

While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. \\n\\nWhen we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. \\n\\nEncouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don’t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. \\n\\nPlease think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts.

       "  'We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).\\n\\nExtended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.\\n\\nEventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. \\n\\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.\\n\\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\\n\\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems.

She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn\\'t feel like it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i\\'ve never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlong with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents \"expect\" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was \"grounded\" because i turned my phone off in the theater.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don\\'t know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I\\'m nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I\\'m expected to be her \"slave\" for the rest of my life.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me.

Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don\\'t despise my sister. It\\'s not her fault that she was born the way she is.

They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house.

We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up.

She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us.

Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids.

       "  'New to reddit, please bare with. \\n\\nSo I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. \\n\\nHowever, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she\\'s never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I\\'m usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she\\'s done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I\\'ve been under the covers and she hasn\\'t seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says \"but I didn\\'t\". \\n\\nWhen she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn\\'t speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I\\'d \"threatened\" to do it before (I literally just said \"okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything\" before). They\\'re now framing this to others that I\\'m some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that\\'s how I get my rocks off, and I\\'m kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?',\n",

       "  'So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. \\n\\nI tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. \\n\\nHe said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. \\n\\nLast week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. \\n\\nI confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. \\n\\nWife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible. \\n\\nAITA? I stand by what I said.',\n",

       "  'Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.\\n\\nI’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.\\n\\nMy brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.\\n\\nSo my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.\\n\\nI’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.\\n\\nBut he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.\\n\\nAnyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.\\n\\nUntil a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.\\n\\nIf it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason\\n\\nI asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. \\n\\nI didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse\\n\\nWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.\\n\\nNext day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.\\n\\nHe eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us\\n\\nThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?\\n\\nPS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!\\n\\nPS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!\\n\\nUpdate: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.\\n\\nClarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.',\n",

       "  '# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. \\n\\n**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!\\n\\n**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**\\n\\n> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. \\n\\n> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread\\'s creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)\\n\\n> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread\\'s creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We\\'re taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)\\n\\n> Unfortunately, we can\\'t ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. \\n\\n**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**\\n\\n> We don\\'t have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?\\n\\n> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don\\'t always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). \\n\\n\\n**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n-----\\n-----\\n-----\\n------\\n-----\\n-----\\n-----\\n-----\\n-----\\n-----\\n\\n# Original Thread Info\\n\\nHey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread\\'s creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). \\n\\nWe think that\\'s a problem. A comment shouldn\\'t be considered \"top\" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we\\'ve decided to fuck with the sub. \\n\\n---\\n\\n# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode\\n\\nFor the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be \"Best\" instead. \\n\\n**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn\\'t have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one\\'s comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn\\'t work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread\\'s popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.',\n",

       "  '**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy intent was to answer more questions since I wasn\\'t able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I\\'ve been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nJust a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I\\'m leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there\\'s a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we\\'re together now and that\\'s what counts.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m sorry if I didn\\'t respond to your comment or private message. I\\'m still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can\\'t even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\---------------------------------------------\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBack in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I\\'ve ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state\\'s care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven\\'t spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn\\'t let him go to my girlfriend because they didn\\'t consider her family.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSince my release, I\\'ve learned that I can\\'t sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I\\'ve gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn\\'t even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town\\'s name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it\\'s gotten someone high up\\'s attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn\\'t illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating \"mistakes can happen.\" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn\\'t happening.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter the visit I received, I\\'m more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don\\'t plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I\\'m being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?\\n\\nEdit: Grammar',\n",

He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. \\n\\nHe’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. \\n\\nI live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. \\n\\nSo last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. \\n\\nTonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”\\n\\nI snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. \\n\\nHe told my family and they think i’m the asshole.

Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots.

Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me.

So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.\\n\\nYou may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:\\n\\n* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!\\n* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!\\n* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.\\n\\nAs you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)\\n\\nAlso important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own.

       "  'AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?',\n",
       "  'Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.\\n\\nThis is a throwaway and it\\'s still fresh and I\\'m really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.\\n\\nMe: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?\\n\\nMy Mom: Nothing.\\n\\nA long ass pause.\\n\\nMe: What do you mean she doesn\\'t pay rent?\\n\\nMy Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn\\'t pay a fucking thing!\\n\\nMy dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn\\'t paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn\\'t pay rent. She doesn\\'t pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she\\'s been living rent free while I\\'ve been paying my parents.\\n\\nSo later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn\\'t want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.\\n\\nThe conversation ended with this:\\n\\nSister: **FUCK YOU. I\\'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)\\n\\nSo my sister storms off to her room and it\\'s now me, my parents in the living room. I\\'m extremely upset at this because it\\'s massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone\\'s angry at each other and my dad\\'s angry my sister won\\'t pay rent and she won\\'t move out and both my parents don\\'t want to police involved.\\n\\nSo I say my part before leaving.\\n\\nMe: I\\'m not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It\\'s only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she\\'s being.\\n\\nMy mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-\\n\\nMe: No.\\n\\nMy mom: But [me], we really need the money...\\n\\nMe: That\\'s too bad.\\n\\nI get up and go off to my room.\\n\\nSo this morning my dad comes in tells me that I\\'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it\\'s the right thing to do and all this shit. I\\'m like, \"what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!\"\\n\\nMy mom, who\\'s listening in.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve seen her! She won\\'t listen to us!\"\\n\\nMe: WELL THAT\\'S TOO BAD.\\n\\nMy mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN\\'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN\\'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.\\n\\nThat was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.\\n\\nAs I\\'m typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents.

       "  \"My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.\\n\\nFor example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.\\n\\nSo, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?\\n\\nEdit: I don't live in the USA. Please don't discuss legalities based on the laws there.\",\n",

       "  'This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don\\'t know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\\n\\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don\\'t you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn\\'t matter to me anyway.\\n\\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let\\'s call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don\\'t know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\\n\\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\\n\\nShe had posts saying \\'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine\\'s\", \\'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends\\',\\'he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people\\' \\'#uglypeoplematter\\' etc. Beck\\'s friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid \\'positive role model\\' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn\\'t hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\\n\\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend\\'s at work and family as alibi.\\n\\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\\n\\nEdit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.\\n\\nI sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.\\n\\nEdit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can\\'t thank you guys enough. I showed my parent\\'s these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.\\n\\nBUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.\\n\\nI am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It\\'s NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that\\'s appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It\\'s honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. \\n\\nI thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don\\'t tell me to take \\'the red pill\\' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever.

I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. \\n\\nShe’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.\\n\\nEver since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. \\n\\nMy own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. \\n\\nAnyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. \\n\\nMy stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. \\n\\nI just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I’m justified in saying no.',\n",

       "  \"Hi all. \\n\\nI gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. \\n\\nMy cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. \\n\\nIt was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.\\n\\nToday I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. \\n\\nI have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. \\n\\nAm I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?\",\n",

       "  'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/\\n\\nI posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and I were having with our baby\\'s name. We had already decided on a girl\\'s name because it honors his mother but we\\'re stuck on a boy\\'s name. My husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black American culture. I wanted a more neutral name since I am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. We found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. His name will be....\\n\\nMiles Trayvon\\n\\nWe thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband\\'s family tends to use middle names a lot so he\\'ll probably be \"Tray\" to most of them. When he\\'s in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn\\'t want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem\\'s character says something like, \"This guy\\'s a gangsta? His real name is Clarence.\" That\\'s not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. He\\'s an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.\\n\\nI had the opposite experience. My mom is white and my dad is black. They decided on a stereotypical black name and I think it made my life harder. Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, \"Her name is Daisy.\" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put \"Ray Smith\", Demarcus Jones would put \"Marcus Jones\", Keshawnda Nelson would put \"Shawna Nelson\", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.\\n\\nAnyway, sorry for the long update. I just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. We didn\\'t really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That\\'s not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don\\'t mean to offend anyone. It\\'s a family name on my husband\\'s side.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the DMs but please stop sending me articles about the woman named Marijuana Pepsi and the black Spider-Man named Miles. Thanks y\\'all.',\n",

       "  'I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an \"Appletarian\", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. \\n\\nI told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. \\n\\nApples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. \\n\\nFinally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\\n\\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \\n\\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \\n\\nI thought they\\'d appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \\n\\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \\n\\nBut, did I go too far?\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"Hello,\\n\\nThis is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/\\n\\nThis last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \\n\\nThis spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. \\n\\nAt the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact.

       "  'I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.\\n\\nShe exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.\\n\\nAfter her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.\\n\\nBut I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.\\n\\nHer boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.\\n\\nI’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?',\n",

So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \\n\\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host\\'s girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they\\'d noticed me eating the sandwich.

I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that\\'s not fucking sharing is it?\" \\n\\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \\n\\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host\\'s girlfriend\\'s best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night.

This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.',\n",

       "  'My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I’ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I’ve always been supportive of him and his identity. \\n\\nI’ve been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It’s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. \\n\\nAfter that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn’t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it’s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his “step grandparents” in the future anyway. I still don’t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?',\n",

Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it’d be fun to act like college students again.\\n\\nWe all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever.

He was my everything and more and I still don’t know how I’m going to move on.\\n\\nConnor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn’t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn’t think when he said those words.

       "  'I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We\\'ve all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \\n\\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It\\'s called gridiron you moron\".  I don\\'t understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \\n\\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I\\'m a Biomed Engineer\". I don\\'t know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I\\'m just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I\\'m just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\\n\\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me \\'drone\\' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn\\'t want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a \\'pussy\\'. \\n\\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He\\'d say stuff like \"His posts suck. They\\'re not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \\n\\n\\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He\\'s a \\'photographer\\' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it\\'s still terrible. I\\'d say he\\'s more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \\n\\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn\\'t met him since the post) and said, \"I\\'m sorry you didn\\'t get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I\\'d rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I\\'m doing is making real art and it\\'s something your robot brain won\\'t ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \\n\\nThat\\'s it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You\\'re a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You\\'re not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \\n\\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA?

       "  \"WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?\",\n",
       "  'I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn\\'t been a lot of overt racism, but there\\'s been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver\\'s license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, \\'So... Beyonce.\\'\\n\\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I\\'m coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more \\'black sounding\\' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the \\'big boss\\' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I\\'m in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It\\'s Tina!\\n\\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I\\'m considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\\n\\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\\n\\nTina: No problem, Chad!\\n\\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\\n\\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\\n\\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it\\'s passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn\\'t worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\\n\\nEDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\\n\\nA lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That\\'s what I\\'ve been doing, and was my first line of defense!\\n\\nA lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn\\'t really help with, and it isn\\'t as serious as it could be.\\n\\nA lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn\\'t race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn\\'t overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\\n\\nAnd finally, a few people have asked why I don\\'t use Tina Turner as an example, since she\\'s also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used \\'Tina Turner\\' as an example for our Dean and he then \\'affectionately\\' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\\n\\nEDIT #2:\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have a southern accent. I\\'m from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don\\'t really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my \\'working in an office\\' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name \\'Tina\\' sound like \\'Tiana\\' or \"Tiara\"\\n\\nNo, the people I work with aren\\'t just \\'idiots.\\' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.\\n\\nNo, I can\\'t wear a \\'Hi, my name is\\' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!\\n\\nYes, I correct them every time.\\n\\nNo, it\\'s not because I\\'m not \\'memorable\\' or a bad employee!\\n\\nResponding to this post saying, \\'Okay Shaniqua\\' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing (\\'Tiana\\' being the \\'Shaniqua\\' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, \\'Okay, Trayvon\\' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy \\'Chad\\' is VERY WEIRD!',\n",

       "  'About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). \\n\\nThe wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. \\n\\nVery few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...\\n\\nWe’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. \\n\\nCarol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. \\n\\nFor me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.',\n",

       "  'My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL’s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as “a vapid slut” and her husband “a pathetic cuck” along with other slurs I don’t want to repeat.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that’s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister’s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I’m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We’re definitely concerned for our daughter about what’s happening at school and we’re looking into therapy.\\n\\nFor clarification, as for my SIL’s privacy, she didn’t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.',\n",

       "  'Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.\\n\\nOn Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.\\n\\n5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something\\'s wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn\\'t stopped crying for hours and she couldn\\'t even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\\n\\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\\n\\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I\\'ll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.\\n\\n2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother\\'s wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.\\n\\nThe logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: \"Well, it was a mistake, she didn\\'t do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn\\'t die!\" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn\\'t fucking die!\\n\\nMy sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding \"over *that*?!\" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it\\'s mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can\\'t even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn\\'t fucking 17, she is 27!\\n\\nBy the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It\\'s not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I\\'d be lying if I said I wasn\\'t worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.\\n\\nI\\'m 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn\\'t about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don\\'t want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I\\'d rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she\\'d accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don\\'t want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**',\n",

Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.\\n\\nAnd that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.\\n\\nAITA for what I did?\",\n",

I\\'ve been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio\\'s Dad (Dynasis).  He\\'s pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio\\'s life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I\\'ve tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn\\'t answer, then called Dynasis, who didn\\'t answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she\\'ll be handed over to juvenile.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI didn\\'t say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we\\'re in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I\\'m telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don\\'t voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don\\'t appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I\\'m not her Dad so don\\'t ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I\\'ve treated her as my own daughter.

She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because \"she\\'s not wrong, you\\'re not her Dad.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she\\'s involved in.

       "  'So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \\nHe told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out. \\n\\nAs stated before I hate cheaters and I’ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don’t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\\n\\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she’s a close friend. WIBTA?\\n\\nEdit: I’m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.\\n\\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did!

       "  'I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don’t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \\n\\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we’ve hosted them in the past when they’ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \\n\\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn’t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \\n\\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here’s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn’t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn’t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn’t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn’t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \\n\\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should’ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEDIT for added info: \\n\\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There’s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \\n\\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad’s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I’m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he’s the generation after mine in our family tree and it’s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it’s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don’t care, and my family’s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it’s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don’t know how after this situation). \\n\\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he’s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son’s safety. I didn’t know how he would react and followed my cousin’s lead, but wasn’t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \\n\\n3. I don’t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don’t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we’ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.',\n",

We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. \\n\\nTori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. \\n\\nHe’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.\\n\\nI couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. \\n\\nI told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.\\n\\nWhat was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” \\n\\nHe hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).\\n\\nMy family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?\\n\\nINFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.\\n\\nEdit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \\n\\nI never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \\n\\nI told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \\n\\nHe was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.',\n",

       "  'AITA for using money we \"earmarked\" for our 6 month old\\'s college fund to buy back the exact 1972 Ford Bronco I owned as a teenager?',\n",
       "  'So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I\\'m hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. \\n\\nWhen I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don\\'t recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn\\'t involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I\\'ve always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \\n\\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she\\'s back at work and she\\'s realized that she hates all the day cares we\\'ve tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she\\'s still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she\\'s having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \\n\\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town\\'s warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn\\'t MY BRONCO! \\n\\nI asked him if he\\'d ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife\\'s parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can\\'t afford right now but it\\'s mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can\\'t even describe what a joy this is. \\n\\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that\\'s setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn\\'t have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it\\'s the literal meaning of happiness.\\n\\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?\\n\\nEdit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she’s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She’s always been awesome to me and she’s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly\\n\\nedit2: are the “mommy bailed you out” comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it’s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it’s not like I’m not paying for it on my own eventually.\\n\\nEdit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?\\n\\nEdit4: I’m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I’m still reading because honestly I’m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another\\n\\nEdit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you’re a mod, do you know? I can’t respond to any posts and get the “status 403” whenever I try. Thanks!\\n\\nEdit in the morning: I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many private’s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn’t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I’ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I “had come to your senses” I don’t want to disappoint her. It’s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.',\n",

       "  'Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.\\n\\nA few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.\\n\\nI pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn’t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.\\n\\nI’ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they’re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn’t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?\\n\\nEdit- okay I get it I’m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn’t think the triplets had different fathers. I’m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair',\n",

       "  'AITA for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?',\n",
       "  'This happened a couple weeks ago, but I\\'m still conflicted about it, so here goes. \\n\\nI travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. Most recently, I was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. This wouldn\\'t be a problem except that I had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket I paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way I had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (Because I take this specific route and airline a lot, I knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can\\'t recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since I just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)\\n\\nOf course, when it came time to board, I get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. I politely told her that she\\'d made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. Her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before I got there, and would I do her the favor of just switching?\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing: if circumstances were different, I would have! But I explained that I had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that I could sleep. I really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids\\' seatbelts RIGHT THEN AND THERE. \\n\\nBy this point the plane is filling up, I\\'m blocking the aisle, it\\'s causing a whole thing, so I just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. The mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. The flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as I did) goes, \"This is an exit row. Your kids can\\'t sit there because they\\'re not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. There\\'s not going to *be* another empty row. Please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.\"\\n\\nSo I sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and I figure that\\'s the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, I push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. When we land, I\\'m getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, \"You look like you slept well, bitch.\"\\n\\nSo, Reddit. Am I the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?\\n\\n**EDITED TO ADD:** Okay, thanks Reddit, I think most of you agree that I\\'m not the asshole here. But please do me a favor and don\\'t refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. The kids were just fine. They watched something on their iPad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. Kids don\\'t like flying more than anyone else, and it\\'s not these girls\\' fault their mom acted like a jerk.',\n",

Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.\\n\\nMy husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it\\'s really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said \"We might not even have kids\" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.\\n\\nSo this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.\\n\\nI was annoyed by this and said \"There\\'s really no chance.\"\\n\\nMIL, all wide-grin, said, \"Oh come on! It\\'s time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!\"\\n\\nI said \"We\\'ve been official for about 5 years now, MIL,\" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.\\n\\nMIL gets more annoyed and says \"Well, you won\\'t be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!\"\\n\\nHusband said, \"Mom, enough.\" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.\\n\\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said \"MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We\\'re not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.\"\\n\\nWell, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman\\'s greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how \"I guess I wasn\\'t a good enough mother and won\\'t be graduating to grandmother.\" It\\'s obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.\\n\\nMy MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really \"need\" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said \"Well then, I guess you two aren\\'t prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I\\'d like a refund for what we paid for the wedding.\" (It wasn\\'t that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)\\n\\nI hung up on her.

At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don’t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened.

I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\\n\\nIt was a gift card. \\n\\n\\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn’t read the text that said “gift card” on the bottom.\\n\\nI’m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like “alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.” But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\\n\\nTL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\\n\\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not.

I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we\\'ll call her \\'Anna\\', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don\\'t support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \\n\\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She\\'ll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man\\'s.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\\n\\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned.

I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \\n\\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn\\'t have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends.

The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \\n\\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \\n\\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night.

She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). \\n\\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \\n\\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...\\n\\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\\n\\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \\n\\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn’t I tell her earlier and she’s so proud of me\\n\\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\\n\\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\\n\\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn’t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \\n\\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\\n\\n> I’m sorry for how I reacted; please don’t be mad. I’m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It’s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you’re going to be where I wanted to be and I’m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I’m sorry I’m ranting I just need more time\\n\\nI’m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don’t. I don’t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I’m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don’t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we’re going to drift apart which would suck because we’re best friends and I just don’t want to lose my sister :(\\n\\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \\n\\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\\n\\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\\n\\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\\n\\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)\",\n",

Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn\\'t expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that \"fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!\" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI noped out of there fast as I could.

       "  'A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated \"No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you.\" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn\\'t think much of the disclaimer at the time because it\\'s a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\\n\\nYesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I\\'m talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I\\'m marrying the SIL, but that was it.\\n\\nA few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should\\'ve specified \"not formal\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she\\'s family doesn\\'t give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I\\'ll talk to her when she\\'s ready to be less verbally abusive.\\n\\nWas I in the wrong?\\n\\nEdit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.\\n\\nEdit 2: My brother said I\\'m welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that\\'s a good sign.\\n\\nEdit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I\\'m sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she\\'s still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head.

       "  'AITA for telling a friend’s friend that he couldn’t keep the “jackpot” that he hit on my antique slot machine? (About $700)',\n",
       "  'I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.\\n\\nOver the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \\n\\nWell a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. \\n\\nSo was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?\\n\\nEdit: sorry guys I can\\'t answer such witticisms as \"why are you so shity?\" because I\\'ve been banned.\\n\\nEdit2: wow since I’m a “baby gangster” who has been running an “illegal gaming operation” (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I’m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.\\n\\nEdit3: gotta address this one directly:\\n\\n>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state\\'s gambling commission.\\n\\nIf the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I’ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the “winner” thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN’T be this dramatic in real life...I’m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I’m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don’t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don’t  in the process.\\n\\nEdit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. \\n\\nSay you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you\\'d say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.\\n\\n\\nEdit5: a good question:\\n\\n>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren\\'t running a casino.\\n\\nNo he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don\\'t mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.\\n\\nEdit6: another good question\\n\\n>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?\\n\\n\\nI would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn\\'t give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I\\'m asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn\\'t have been backed into a corner.\\n\\nEdit7: \\n\\n>INFO\\nWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine\\n\\nSo this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there\\'s a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it\\'s now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I\\'d say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I\\'ve ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine \"nerd\" could correct me if I\\'m way off base.\\n\\nEdit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can\\'t let it get buried.\\n\\n> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.\\n\\nEdit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say \"your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?\"  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.\\n\\n1. I wasn\\'t profiting off this machine. I\\'ve literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.\\n\\n2. I can\\'t afford to give a random dude $700. I don\\'t need it now, but I have savings account I don\\'t need it now either but I might some day. And now I\\'ve found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can\\'t wait for the \"you\\'re a stupid thot\" rationalizations to come from this one). \\n\\n3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. \\n\\n4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn\\'t have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. \\n\\n5. As an example, Over the years it\\'s mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn\\'t win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).\\n\\nEdit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:\\n\\n>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit\\n\\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\\n\\n\\nEdit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM\\'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it\\'s based around a pretty well known model from that era (don\\'t want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit \"guest\" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn\\'t a jackpot at all. I don\\'t have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that\\'s what happened. The guy said there\\'s an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn\\'t bet on it.  I still don\\'t care if I\\'m YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.\\n\\n\\nEdit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the \"winner\" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the \"malfunction voids all pays and plays\" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.',\n",

Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.\\n\\nHere’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. \\n\\nFast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald.

I have served all kinds of clients.\\n\\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\\n\\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there\\'s all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray\\'s Peak.

No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \\n\\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \\n\\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn\\'t believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\\n\\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn\\'t going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I\\'m mocking them, etc.\\n\\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren\\'t realistic with their expectations. \\n\\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people.

I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. \\n\\nthe next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. \\n\\nwith Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page. \\n it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life. \\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nedit 1 \\nI've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him.\",\n",

       "  'Last week, I was using my sister Ashley’s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” \\n\\nI decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. \\n\\nI created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. \\n\\nI decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. \\n\\nAfter she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger’s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. \\n\\nI told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a “fucking dick” and “cruel” to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who’s right and if I went too far?\\n\\nEDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would’ve had sex with Jim. That’s why I went the extent that I did.\\n\\nAlright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I’m TA. But I’m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. \\n\\nAnd to the people who said she’ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯',\n",

Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don’t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend “Ugh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.”\\n\\nI shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I’m not entirely sure if it’s an actual well known exercise) \\n\\nThe same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf “Look there she goes again, and her forms terrible.” Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.\\n\\nAt this point I call her out. I said “Oi, you.” She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically “You in the purple top.” \\n\\nShe turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:\\n\\nMe; Do you want to fuck me?\\nHer: What?!\\nMe: I said do you want to fuck me?\\nHer: What the fuck is wrong with you?\\nMe: Well you keep staring at me, so I’m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?\\n\\nShe went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn’t see them again.\\n\\nWhen I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. \\n\\nMy defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn’t talk shit if she doesn’t want called out on it.\\n\\nI’ll admit that I’m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business.',\n",

I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.\\n\\n\\nMy father\\'s 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it\\'s their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids\\' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\" get out and enjoy their reunion.\\n\\n\\nSo I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. \\n\\n\\nWhen my 3 uncles\\' families\\' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn\\'t a share for me. Now, I don\\'t really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\\n\\n\\nI put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a \"kid\", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.\\n\\n\\nI got the biggest shit from my parents after they left.

Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn’t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn’t even have Candy Crush on her phone.\\n\\nSo I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn’t do it).\\n\\nAfter dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn’t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nEdit: Yep, I\\'m reading the replies, all 3K of them, it\\'s all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than \"I\\'m sorry you\\'re right\" people will say \"Accept your judgment!\" and if I reply \"Thanks\" to an NTA I will be told I\\'m just looking for validation.\\n\\nShout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote:\\n\\nLooks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies.

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that\\'s what they\\'re doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they\\'re secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it\\'s honestly ridiculous they\\'ll sent texts like \"I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago\" \"They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they\\'re headed to the skate park\". I think it\\'s hilarious because our neighborhood isn\\'t dangerous at all.\\n\\nOne of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son \\'Jake\\' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won\\'t respond.\\n \\nNow yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn\\'t answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there\\'s Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she\\'s all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven\\'t seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn\\'t hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she\\'s a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.\\n\\nMy boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn\\'t have said that stuff about the divorce.
